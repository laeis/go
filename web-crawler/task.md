Exercise: Web Crawler
In this exercise you'll use Go's concurrency features to parallelize a web crawler.

// Crawl uses fetcher to recursively crawl
// pages starting with url, to a maximum of depth.
func Crawl(url string, depth int, fetcher Fetcher) {
	// TODO: Fetch URLs in parallel.
	// TODO: Don't fetch the same URL twice.
	// This implementation doesn't do either:
	if depth <= 0 {
		return
	}
	body, urls, err := fetcher.Fetch(url)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("found: %s %q\n", url, body)
	for _, u := range urls {
		Crawl(u, depth-1, fetcher)
	}
	return
}

Modify the Crawl function to fetch URLs in parallel without fetching the same URL twice.

Hint: you can keep a cache of the URLs that have been fetched on a map, but maps alone are not safe for concurrent use!
